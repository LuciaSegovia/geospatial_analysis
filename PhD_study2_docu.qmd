# Intro

The objectives of these exploratory analysis are:

1)  to calculate the mean/median wealth and education level for each EA in Malawi, and to see if there are differences

2)  to start evaluating how to calculate the mean/median maize Se concentration at different level of spatial aggregation (i.e., from 5km radius up to regional averages).

## Dataset & Variables

1.  Malawi maize grain and soil Se concentration dataset. It is publicly available [here](https://github.com/rmlark/GeoNutrition/tree/main/Soil_Crop_comparisons/Malawi)

-   Crop
-   Se_triplequad
-   Zn
-   pH_Wa (pH in water)
-   N_pct
-   Org_pct
-   BIO1

2.  Malawi DHS -- MNS 2015-2016. Access need to be requested to DHS data\[Add link\]().

**File of interest & variables**:

a. Micronutrient survey data (MW_WRA). This dataset provided information on biomarker data and other biological data for women of reproductive age in Malawi. 

-   mregion (region) [1-3 = N->S]
-   mtype (urban/rural) [U-R = 1-2] 
-   m04  (gender)
-   mcluster (PSU?)
-   mnumber
-   mweight (survey weight)
-   m01 (line number - individual ID within HH)
-   m07 (age)
-   m435 (weight)
-   m436 (height)
-   sel (Plasma Se (ng/ml))


b. Questionnaire data (MWIR7). This dataset provided inforamtion on socioeconomic factors. We downloaded both the .dat and .dta file because the file with .dat extansion was not opening in R. It was not corrupted as we could open the .MAP with Notepad+, and we could see all recode doucmentation. 

These variables provide information at indiviual level.

Variables of interest:

-   v101/V024 (De facto region of residence)
-   sdist - (district). 
-   v022 (survey strata). Note that v022 & v023 are strata Urban/rural district.
-   v005 (Woman's sample weights, divide it by 1000000 before applying the weighting factor)

-   v106 (Highest educational level)

-   v155 (Literacy)

-   v190 (Wealth index)

-   v002 (Household number)

-   v001 (Cluster number)

b.  MWGE7AFL (geographic data) ïƒ  Variable: DHSCLUST (to be used w/ V001). 

GPS displacement within district. 

#TODO: Check README and recommended readings to understand displacement and what it is possible and not possible for analysis.

# Exploratory analysis

## 1) Micronutrient survey data (MW_WRA)

There are `r sum(!is.na(EligibleDHS$selenium))` entries for plasma Se in the dataset.

### Age
-  There are some observation (n = `r sum(Malawi_WRA$AGE_IN_YEARS<15 | Malawi_WRA$AGE_IN_YEARS>49)`) that are below the age range for WRA. 
In addition, mean (and median) were higher in the northern region compared with southern and center. Whereas, mean/median age were higher in rural areas. We applied survey weights when calculating them. 

### Gender & Pregnancy
- There is one entry labelled as "male" while the dataset should only contain women.  

### Height & Weight
-  There are outliers in height which are higher than 2m, some are coded as 999, we can assume those are missing values (NA) according to the coding standards reported in (ICF. 2018. Demographic and Health Surveys Standard Recode Manual for DHS7. The Demographic
and Health Surveys Program. Rockville, Maryland, U.S.A.: ICF). There is also one observation with a recorded height of 100.2.  
-  There are some outliers in weight as well of higher than expented, on the lower bound seems plausible given age and height.
-  We generated BMI variable which also has some outliers due to the high weight of some WRA. 

### Selenium

Se median (and mean) values were higher in urban settings than in rural, and the highest in the southern region. Then, the median dissagregated by region and urbanity showed that northern and southern urban population had the highest Plasma Se median, while the centre region were the lowest, particuarly for rural WRA. 

What it is interesting is that while the Northern-urban WRA had higher Se, than their southern counterpart, the Southern-rural WRA had higher plasma Se than their northern counterparts. In addition, wRA who live in urban setting of the centre region had similar plasma Se median concentration as women in the northern region in rural settings. 

## 2) Socio-Economic data (DHSDATA)

We extracted the socio-economic information from the DHS survey, however, we are only interested in the data that has Plasma Se values. 

According to the NSO (2017) report: Malawi Micronutrient Survey 2015-2016. There were significative differences between the number of indiviudals in each wealth quintile when disaggregated by rural/urban residency. 
#TODO: Would that impact our results? Probably yes. Check what that would mean for our analysis. 

In the same report, inflamation was reported around 12% but it was consistent across age groups, residency, and wealth Q. However, malaria prevalence was higher in rural areas and for the different wealth Q, w/ lowest WQ being 6-times higher than the highes WQ. Since, these two variables seemed to be also related to Plasma Se status. Can we identify if malaria is influencing Se status?
#TODO: Check correlation btween malaria and Se status. 

When plotting wealth quintiles we can see that were more HH on the highest wealth Q. 

When plotting wealth and education, we can see that lowest wealth Q has no women with high education. 

Similarly, we can see that `r sum(DHSDATA$education_level >1 & DHSDATA$Literacy == 0)` women reported no literacy (0), but secondaty education (2).

All education and wealth level have representation in all three regions. Again, when looking at the data we could see that there is a slight "over-reporting" of the wealthiest Quintiles. 

## 3) Combining DHS datasets: Plasma Se & covariates

According to Phiri et al (2019), the influencing factors for Plasma Se (for WRA) in Malawi were soil type and proximity to Lake Malawi. 

In addition, other authors have reported that socio-economic characteristics may influence Se status. 

Here we are exploring the variabilty of Plasma Se according to those variables. First within the same dataset.


### Wealth
Plasma Se values were similar across wealth Q, with higher variability in the two lowest Q. 

### Education level
Plasma Se values were slightly higher in the highest education level, with lower variablity, while the opposite was true for the primary education level. 

### Place of residency

Plasma Se values were similar when aggregated by region, whereas we can start seeing some differences when we are plotting the results by district. Also notice, that the number of observations per district is 1) much smaller and 2) much diverse (from `r min(table(EligibleDHS$sdist))` to `r max(table(EligibleDHS$sdist))`). 

#TODO: Check weighting and how to apply them to the survey, including to plotting the data.

#TODO: Generate a dataset with districs and soil type, and proximity to the Lake Malawi (from the "centre of the district" to the lake) - Ask Liberty/ Louise whether that have been created previosly. 

### Smoking
Only 3 respondent reported smoking cigarettes, if we want to include this varable, we may need to combine with other smoking variables (including the other variables), although I believe that women who smoke in this context it may be very low.
#TODO: Check smoking incidence in WRA in Malawi.




After merging the datasets, some Wealth quintile were missing, hence following recomendations form F.S we used the household wealth quintile  for those available to impute it. This was available for 17 of the 39 observation with missing values.

## 4) Maize Se concentration in Malawi

We extracted the variables of interest from the dataset, then we are doing some data operations, for instance, removing NAs, and transforming Se in dry weight (mcg/kg DW) to Se in fresh weght (mcg/100g FW EP). 

#REVIEW: Moisture assumptions
Because, moisture content was not estimated, we are assuming same moisture content as the one measuere in the study of Hwang et al., (2016) for white maize. This is one of the assumptions that should be listed and tested, as for that study we have some data with their respective GPS, hence some extra analysis could be performed


There is a missmatch between the EAs and the maize Se conc. sampling. Resulting in 2200 () EAs without a maize Se conc. value. There are two potentital reasons for this to happen:

1) The boundaries are not equivalent with the coordinates. Making for the points to not be well nested or allocated to the correct EA. We have checked the method and it seemed that there is no issue with some points being either omitted. However, I believe that the values have been aggregated because there is no dupplicated ID_3.

Also there are 3 rows lost, which are also lost when subsetting using either st_within or st_intersect. This maybe due to 3 points being outside the boudaries used. 

#TODO: Check if the same is happening with district level boundaries (as they are more official)

2) No actual samples were collected for certain EAs.

It could be also a combination of both.
