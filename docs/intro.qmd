## Introduction {.unnumbered}



### Aims of the study

We want to know whether: 

a)  Observed estimates provides better prediction/ explanation of the plasma Se than predicted estimates? 

b)  At what level of maize Se aggregation plasma Se concentration is better explained? 


### Objectives {.unnumbered}

The objectives of these documentation and the exploratory analysis are:

1)  to document the cleaning steps and decision made that may influence the analysis and subsequent results.

2)  to evaluate the different variables that will be used in the analysis

3) to document and calculate the mean/median maize Se concentration at different level of spatial aggregation (i.e., from 5km radius up to regional averages).
