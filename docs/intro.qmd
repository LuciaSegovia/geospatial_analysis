### Aim of the study


a)  At what level of spatial aggregation of maize Se concentration, plasma Se concentration was better explained/described, after accounting for individual-level factors of plasma Se concentration variability? 

b)  To confirm that prediction of maize Se concentration provides more accurate estimates when compared with plasma Se concentration in women in Malawi.  

### Objectives {.unnumbered}

The objectives of these documentation and the exploratory analysis are:

1)  to document the cleaning steps and decision made that may influence the analysis and subsequent results.

2)  to evaluate the different variables that will be used in the analysis

3) to document and calculate the mean/median maize Se concentration at different level of spatial aggregation (i.e., from 10km radius up to district averages).
